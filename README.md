Data Structures and algorithms - cpp version -

**1. bubblesortsimple.cpp :** Simple bubble sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. This program creates random numbers with a limit and adds 
them to a vector. Then it uses the bubble sort simple to order them in ascending order, show the iterations the algorithm had.

**2. bubblesortoptimized.cpp :** Optimized bubble sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. This program is similar to the simple version, but with a flag that tells the program the order has been made and so, saving us from more iterations.

**3. insertionsort.cpp :** insertion sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. Similar to the bubble simple version.

**4. selectionsort.cpp :** Selection sort algorithm with STL vector of integers.
