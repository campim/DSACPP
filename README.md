Data Structures and algorithms - cpp version -

**1. bubblesortsimple.cpp :** Simple bubble sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. This program creates random numbers with a limit and adds 
them to a vector. Then it uses the bubble sort simple to order them in ascending order, show the iterations the algorithm had.

**2. bubblesortoptimized.cpp :** Optimized bubble sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. This program is similar to the simple version, but with a flag that tells the program the order has been made and so, saving us from more iterations.

**3. insertionsort.cpp :** insertion sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. Similar to the bubble simple version.

**4. selectionsort.cpp :** Selection sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. Ascending or descending order option.

**5. shellsort.cpp :** Shell sort algorithm is a similar general version of the insertion sort algorithm. Also using STL vector of integers.

**6. mergesort.cpp :** Merge sort algorithm, also using random STL vector of integers.

**7. countingsort.cpp :** Counting sort algorithm, create an array of values counting occurrence of values in an index, using random STL vector of integers.

**8. quicksort.cpp :** Quick sort algorithm, using STL vector of integers and random generated numbers to fill it, we use the rightmost element as pivot, and
recursion.

**9. radixsort.cpp :** Radix sort algorithm, using STL vector of integers and random generated numbers. Also using max_element of STL to find the max element, 
and to print the vector we use iterators of the STL vector.

**10. bucketsort.cpp :** Bucket sort algorithm, using STL vector of integers and random generated numbers, also using insertion sort as secondary algorithm for 
sorting elements inside every bucket.

**11. heapsort.cpp :** Heap sort algorithm, using STL vector of integers and random generated numbers. Complete binary tree data structure, recursive.

**12. linearsearch.cpp :** Very simple linear search using STL vector of integers and random generated numbers.

**13. binarysearch.cpp :** Simple binary search example, with quick sort as ordering algorithm and random generated numbers.

**14. simplestack.cpp :** Very simple example of a stack of integers, using STL.
