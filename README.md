Data Structures and algorithms - cpp version -

**1.- bubblesortsimple.cpp :** Simple bubble sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. This program creates random numbers with a limit and adds 
them to a vector. Then it uses the bubble sort simple to order them in ascending order, show the iterations the algorithm had.

**1.- bubblesortoptimized.cpp :** Optimized bubble sort algorithm with STL vector of integers. This program is similar to the simple version, but with a flag that tells the program the order has been made and so, saving us from more iterations.
